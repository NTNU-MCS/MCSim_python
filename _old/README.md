# MCSim Python resources for use with ROS and simulations

## Math tools and functions
Generic Python-based math tools and functions shall be located in folder math_tools. These must be linked in as library files and functions to other nlarger simulation programs or ROS control systems. 

Note: Please be strict about putting generic python functions in MCSim_python repo and specific ROS functions or simulation programs in other relevant repos, e.g. corresponding vessel model repo such as CS_Drillship or the MC-Lab repo.
