# MCSim Python library
The Marine Control Simulation Python is developed by PhD and MTech students within Marine Cybernetics  at NTNU. The Python library builds on the older and more extensive Matlab/Simulink MCSim toolbox, located here: https://github.com/NTNU-MCS/MCSim .  

### lib: Library of generic functions for marine vessels and control systems
### models: Aggregated models for simulating vessel and system responses 
### demos: Packages of parameterized vessel or system models for demonstrating simulation of complete systems
### dev: Projects under development

The library includes functions and aggregated models for configuring more advanced simulation models for marine vessels and their control systems, such as kinematics, rigid-body kinetics, wind, wave, and current loads on structures, thruster models, sensor models, power system models, and so on. Much of this is yet to be developed, but will hopefully emerge over time as a result of collaborative effort.
